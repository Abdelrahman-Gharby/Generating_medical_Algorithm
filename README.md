# Overview
üîç Introduction
This graduation project is an AI-powered medical assistant designed to automatically generate medical decision algorithms based on disease names. The system combines fine-tuned language models with web crawling and interactive visualization to help medical professionals and students make accurate, evidence-based decisions.

üí° Why it's important:
Doctors rely on structured decision algorithms to make critical choices. Manual creation is time-consuming and often lacks up-to-date references. This tool automates the generation of clinical pathways using cutting-edge LLMs and medical sources (e.g. WHO, NICE, CDC), helping improve efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility in healthcare.
